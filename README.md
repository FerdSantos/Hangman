# Hangman

After finishing the tic-tac-toe project, I realized how much you can learn-by-doing

And also a little "sad" feeling came up, which fast became to a "what's next?" kind of feeling

Another classic game came into mind: Hangman! 

My will was to make a Hangman which you can choose a level (easy: 10 lifes and words up to 5 letters ;
medium: 8 lifes and words with 6 to 9 letters ; hard: 6 lifes and words with 10+ letters)

The computer will choose randomly english words from a list of 2466 words (https://www.randomlists.com/data/words.json)


Have fun!

Any suggestions about this code and/or new projects, please feel free to comment
